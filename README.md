>Project on Federated Learning on Multimodal Sensor Data by Byung Woong Ko (Alvin) and Liu Ligeng (Leo)

></br>

>**Motivation:**
>
>The demand for multimodal FL in research community is increasing due to recent emergence of variety of heterogenous sensor deployments with multiple sensing modalities that serve a single learning application. 

>**Design goals:**
>
>Understand and benchmark different multimodal datasets in a federated setting

>**Deliverables:**
>
>Understand multiodal fedrated learning
>
>Reproduce the results in the given paper (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rWJYkfMavGs1F-H0jykJ5V0fIiwrQdJV)
>
>Perform per-class accuracy analysis of the results and observe the effect of skewed data distribution onthe per-class accuracy
>
>Evaluate the system on a multimodal dataset that is relatively balanced in class distribution

>**Note:**
>
> Plots made to reproduce the results and their respective file is in the folder plots (results in zip)

>**HW/SW requirements:**
>
>Python, Laptop with CUDA-enabled GPU (Optional, To be decided)

>**Team members responsibilities**
>
>Each member will pick a role below and work while still being able to support other members who may be having difficulties with thiers, vise versa.

>**Project timeline**
>
>Week1~3 = Reproduce results described in paper
>
>Week4~6 = Implement per-class accuracy
>
>Week7~9 = Analyze the results
>
>Rest    = Report
